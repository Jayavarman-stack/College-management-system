# 🎓 College Management System (C++ | OOP)

A **console-based College Management System** implemented in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
This project demonstrates how real-world college entities such as **Students**, **Courses**, and **Enrollments** can be modeled using classes and STL containers.
